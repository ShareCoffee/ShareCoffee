###Release Notes

  - 0.1.3 - ShareCoffee.Commons.infect() now accepts an optional parameter see (https://github.com/ShareCoffee/ShareCoffee/issues/48)
  - 0.1.2 - Added ShareCoffee.Commons.inject() which is a tiny replacement for spcontext.js
  - 0.1.1 - Added JSONLight Support see my post on http://www.dotnet-rocks.com for more information
  - 0.1.0  - IE8 fixes for REST and CrossDomain. IE8 doesn't allow to call a method named 'for' there is now an alternative method called 'f'. use it like the following ShareCoffee.REST.build.create.f.angularJS()
  - 0.0.13 - Fixed broken NuGet Package
  - 0.0.12 - HashUrls are removed by ShareCoffee.Commons in order to provide a even better angularJS integration.
  - 0.0.11 - ShareCoffee allows you now to inject a custom load method for ShareCoffee.Commons.getFormDigest(). You can either set a method to ShareCoffee.commons.formDigestValue or a string. depending of the type either the function will be invoked or the actual string will be returned; ShareCoffee.Commons.loadAppWebUrlFrom and ShareCoffee.Commons.loadHostWebUrlFrom are now also supporting strings and functions.
  - 0.0.10 - Added $s as a shortcut for ShareCoffee; getFormDigest will now only be called when not executing GET requests
  - 0.0.9 - With ShareCoffee 0.0.9 the class ShareCoffee.CrossDomain.SharePointRestProperties has been removed from the project. Use ShareCoffee.REST.RequestProperties insted.
  - 0.0.8 - With ShareCoffee 0.0.8 the classes ShareCoffee.REST.angularProperties,
    ShareCoffee.REST.reqwestProperties and ShareCoffee.REST.jQueryProperties
    has been removed from the project. Instead you should either use a plain
    JSON object for configuring REST requests or you can create instances from the
    ShareCoffee.REST.RequestProperties class.
